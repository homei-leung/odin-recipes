    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Easiest Kimchi recipe ever.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6.6 lb green cabbage</li>
        <li>1 cup coarse sea salt</li>
        <li>4-5 green onions</li>
        <li>1 cup Korean chili pepper flakes (gochugaru)</li>
        <li>5 tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tbsp minced ginger</li>
        <li>4 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fish sauce</li>
        <li>2 yellow onions</li>
        <li>1 red apple</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Salt Cabbage</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the cabbage into quarters. Cut out the root part. Cut the cabbage into bite-sized pieces. Rinse under cold water a few times. Drain.</li>
        <li>Put some cabbage on the bottom of a large bowl. Sprinkle some salt over the cabbage. (Don’t add it all at once.) Layer the cabbage, sprinkle some salt, and repeat this process.</li>
        <li>Try to separate each piece as possible as you can. Let sit at room temperature for 2 hours. (Make sure to flip 2 or 3 times so that they can be evenly salted.)</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make Kimchi Paste</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In another bowl, mix together the Korean chili pepper flakes, minced garlic, minced ginger, sugar and fish sauce.</li>
        <li>Roughly chop the onions and apple. Put them in a blender with a splash of water. Blend on high speed until smooth. (If you have plum juice, you can skip the apple and add 1 cup of plum juice instead.) Transfer to the bowl. Mix well. Cover and keep it in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make Cabbage Kimchi</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the green onion into long strips, about 2 inch (5 cm) long.</li>
        <li>Check the cabbage. After 2 hours, the cabbage should be bendable. Drain the cabbage. Thoroughly rinse under cold water at least 3 to 5 times. If it’s not done properly, it can be too salty.</li>
        <li>Pour the kimchi paste over the cabbage. With gloved hands, gently toss together. (You don’t need to coat every single piece. Just try to relocate the cabbage from the bottom. This is the tip!) Add the green onions. Mix again. Serve with hot rice. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
