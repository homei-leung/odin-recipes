    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Korean steamed eggs are a popular Korean side dish you can enjoy any time of the day.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp chicken bouillon powder</li>
        <li>Sliced green oinion, to garnish</li>
        <li>1 tsp toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>Generous pinch of toasted sesame seeds, to garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a small container and beat well. Add 1 cup of water and the chicken bouillon powder. (If you donâ€™t have the chicken bouillon powder, you can substitute with dasida (Korean beef stock powder) or 1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt.)</li>
        <li>To get the silky texture, pour the egg mixture through a fine sieve over a heatproof bowl or ttukbaegi (Korean earthenware pot).</li>
        <li>Place a steamer basket in a pot. Pour in some water. Bring it to a boil. Once the water starts to boil, stir the eggs one more time and cover with foil. Carefully place it in the basket. Cover with the lid. Steam for 2 minutes over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low. Steam for 10 more minutes. Check if the eggs need more time to cook. (Mine is a bit too runny, so I steamed for 3 more minutes.) Once the eggs are cooked, remove from the heat. Top with sliced green onion, sesame oil and sesame seeds. Enjoy it as it is or serve it with hot rice and other side dishes.</li>
    </ol>
