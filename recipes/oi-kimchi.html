    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Oi kimchi (Korean cucumber salad) is crunchy, tangy, spicy, and refreshing with a deep flavor profile. This oi kimchi reciped was created by Aaronandclaire.com.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 English cucumbers</li>
        <li>2 tbsp coarse sea salt</li>
        <li>3.8 oz of green onions</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 tsp grated ginger</li>
        <li>5 tbsp Korean chili pepper flakes (gochugaru)</li>
        <li>5 tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Salt Cucumbers</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim the ends off the cucumbers. Cut the cucumbers in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, scrape out those watery bits. Cut each cucumber in half again lengthwise. Chop them into bite-sized pieces. Transfer to a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the salt over the cucumber pieces. Gently toss them together. (This salting process will draw out the moisture so the cucumbers will become nice and crunchy.)</li>
        <li>Let them sit for 10 minutes. Put them in a colander and let them drain for another 20 minutes. Rinse them in cold water. (Grab a piece and taste. If itâ€™s too salty, give them another rinse.) Drain well.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prep Other Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the green onions into strips, about 2 inches (5 cm) long.</li>
        <li>Finely chop (or blend/grate) the garlic cloves. This will go into the kimchi paste, so make sure to chop them really fine. Grate a small knob of ginger, about 1 teaspoon.</li>
        <li>Make the kimchi paste: Combine all the kimchi paste ingredients in a small container and mix well.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take out the largest mixing bowl. Add the salted cucumbers, along with the kimchi paste. With gloved hands, toss them together. </li>
        <li>Add the green onions. Gently toss everything together until thoroughly mixed. (Give it a quick taste. If you want it to be saltier, add a little bit more fish sauce.)</li>
        <li>Place the cucumber kimchi into an airtight container. Leave it at room temperature for 3 to 4 hours and move it to the fridge. Serve once chilled.</li>
    </ol>
